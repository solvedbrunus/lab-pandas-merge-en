# Lab | Pandas concat, joining and merge

## Introduction

In this lab we want you to learn and investigate some concepts in the context of Pandas: concatenating, joining, and merging. We want to review these concepts because it will make the subsequent work in transforming the datasets a lot more efficient.

## Getting Started


When you are on `pandas_1_concat-merge-join.ipynb`, read the instructions for each cell and provide your answers. Make sure to test your answers in each cell and save. Jupyter Notebook should automatically save your work progress. But it's a good idea to periodically save your work manually just in case.

## Deliverables


- `pandas_1_concat-merge-join.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.


## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
